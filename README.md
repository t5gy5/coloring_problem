# coloring_problem
Given an regular polygon with 2n vertices (n positive integer) and 2n-1 distinct colors,
give a coloring of the edges of the polygon such that from each vertex all colors are visible.

The solution outputs a table where the numbers from the top row and the selected row(S)
form the edges, and the color is the (S)'s position in the table.
